# The Martian Resume
**TMR** is a LaTeX template for a matching **Résumé & Cover Letter** pair, written with minimal interaction in mind. At the beginning of each file is a number of fields for author details, used to generate top- and bottom-matter, followed by a section for the body text or importation of sections. A quick no-fuss way to get simple documents for use anywhere you need to look good.

This package was strongly influenced by (is really just a lightweight version of) **posquit0**'s [**Awesome-CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

# TODO
- Learn about Makefiles or the {subfiles} package: *Make one .tex file that splits and generates both Résumé & Cover Letter*
- Check compatibility of FontAwesome usage on others' machines
- License *License* **LICENSE**
