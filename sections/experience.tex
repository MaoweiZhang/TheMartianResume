	{Bar and Gaming Attendant, Office Assistant}
	{Sherwood Services Club}
	{Mid 2012 - End 2015}
	{Resigned}
	{Initially being hired as a bartender, it was not long before the vast majority of my work was as a gaming cashier, controlling the cash flow within the club, or assisting in the admin/accounts office. My duties as a cashier included swapping money and making change for customers and other areas of the club, counting and sorting tills, making payouts to gaming winners, and assisting managers with all manner of paperwork.\\\\This was fast-paced work that required and bred precision above all else. My time in the admin office had me working both as an office assistant, filing and submitting paperwork, but also dealing with incoming stock, wages and account transactions and their associated software.}

	{Supervisor/Co-ordinator}
	{Elstern Imports}
	{2009 - Mid 2012}
	{Resigned}
	{Starting off at the company when I was 15, I was hired as a casual picker \& packer for a wholesale-only jewellery and medical supplies distribution company. In the time that I was there I rose to hire and supervise 4 other staff (and the whole division of our company that dealt with our chain customers), as the company grew to not only have more wholesale customers than ever, but also run 2 retail web-stores.\\\\My daily tasks were overseeing orders and dispatch, generating digital and hand-written invoices, ordering and receiving of stock from our suppliers, taking complaints, inquiries and orders via phone/email/fax, and managing the bar-coding and stock systems for our end of the warehouse (including implementing a new system when our number of stock lines outgrew the old one), along with many other unique tasks that would crop up every day.}
